OpenEats is a recipe management site that allows users to create, share, and store their personal collection of recipes. This fork uses Django Rest Framework as a backend and React (with flux) as a front end.

The usage for the app is intended for a single user or a small group. For my personal use, I would be an admin user and a few (about 5-6) friends and family would be normal users. Admin users can add other users to the project (no open sign-ups), make changes to the available Cuisines and Courses, and add to the homepage banner. Normal users just have the ability to add recipes. Below are a few of the core features the app provides.

- Creating, viewing, sharing, and editing recipes.
- Update Serving information on the fly.
- Browsing and searching for recipes.
- Creating grocery lists.
- Automatically add recipes to your grocery lists.
- Quickly print recipe.
- Linking recipes and ingredient grouping.
